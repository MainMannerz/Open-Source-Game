Codename Armageddon (Old Version) is a extraction game project I worked on long ago with poor scripting skills and other open source assets.
This open source version has the looting system removed since it's a paid product. The looting system is called LootMod if you're interested.

Please take note that the game is messy since I made this with poor knowledge and game developing skills.


Please don't sell this and the assets used in the game.


List of Notes:
- The game uses ACS 1.7.5 with copy pasted code and assets from Kitsune ACS (released verson).
- I used a modded marine NPC. The original marine npc is by Kangerujack on Youtube.
- Various open source assets we're used, the assets are made by creators such as HowToRoblox on Youtube.
